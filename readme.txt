Theme Name: ThreatToCreativity
Theme URI: http://maxisnow.com/threattocreativity-theme/
Description: <b>NEW FEATURES for version 3</b>: I've added color scheme theme options. After installing or updating the theme, navigate to Appearance > Theme Options to select from pre-loaded color schmede, or toggle custom color scheme to have your own custom color scheme! This theme has a CSS dropdown menu set in reverse order and an intergrated thumbnail excerpt insertion function.<br> Largely inspired by European POP art, this theme is a labour of love. Pieces of code borrowed from all over. The key feature to this theme is the homepage excerpts with randomly generated coloration. It's a real threat to minimalist design and general organic creativity. It's automated and audacious.
Submit any feautre requests via the website! I'll be looking to update and add features in the next month.

NEW FEATURES for version 3.2: I've added color scheme theme options. After installing or updating the theme, navigate to Appearance > Theme Options to select from pre-loaded color schmede, or toggle custom color scheme to have your own custom color scheme! This update also includes the wp_nav_menu theme support and post_thumbnail support.

Use these theme as you please. It would be nice if the footer stayed intact with links back to my site, however I understand that some people want to remove it. I've done it myself before. If you do linkback to me with the theme active on a site, I will probably link to you from my site. Just FYI.
Please find the color code generator in colors.php but all other styles in the theme stylesheet.
