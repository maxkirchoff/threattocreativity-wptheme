ThreatToCreativity Wordpress Theme
==================================

# This theme is no longer supported, however please feel free to fork it!

This is an homage to my designer friends. While I may know why Helvetica is more attractive then Papyrus, thatâ€™s about where my design sensibility ends. An initial effort to develop a monstrous looking blog theme to motivate a designer friend to draw me up a new layout turned into what you see before you, the ThreatToCreativity.

    Really cool features of this theme:
        Color Scheme Options
        Post Thumbnails
        WP Nav Menu Support
        Threaded comments
        Randomly generated style colors
        Homepage cell view
        flexible width
